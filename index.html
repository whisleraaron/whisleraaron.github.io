                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Ohio State Engineering Capstone Project</div>
                    <p>Worked as the team leader and Hardware Lead for a capstone project sponsored by Campus Parc on The Ohio State University's main campus. The project utilized a microcomputer to do the computations on-site and a Campus Parc provided camera to take the video. The project's goal was to gather data about cars going in and out of surface lots on OSU's main parking areas. This was done through the implementation of an AI model to first gather cropped photos of any car in frame; secondly, a separate model then analyzed the cropped photos in order to gain details such as car size, color, and direction.</p>

                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Parcell</div>
                    <p>The goal of the project was to add functionality to the entire Parcell smart toolbox by keeping track of small apex bits for drills using break beam laser sensors. This array kept track of individual apex bits for drills and automatically notified the dropbox system when objects were missing from the apex bit slots. This was accomplished by soldering transistors in an AND gate array to combine the signals and only complete the signal when one or more slots were not occupied. It was designed and built by hand by me and utilized complex soldering of transistors and the break beams themselves.</p>

Some of my other passions include gaming, home coding projects, and spending time with friends. I also love animals and have 2 cats, Morpheus and Artemis, that I love to spend time with.</p>
                    <p>I also enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest tech and world news. I find the global need for tech to be interesting and how this field continues to emerge in the world. I think keeping up-to-date on tech to be an essential part of the engineering field as new technologies might shape the field going forward.</p>
